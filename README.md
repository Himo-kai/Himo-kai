# I’m Himokai

~ Welcome to my little corner of GitHub.

## The “Me” part….
Just a curious soul who likes coding, debating philosphies and ethics, and getting lost in Wikipedia rabbit holes. (Who wants to talk SCP’s lmao)
I’m a fan of minimalism, space stuff, and building things that (hopefully) make life a little better.
Of course I also binge Anime a little to much at times

## How I waste my “Free” time
- Messing around with code (sometimes it works, if I’m lucky.)
- Learning new tech (and forgetting half of it,)
- Philosophy, astronomy, and random science facts
- Finding simple work-arounds to weird problems

## Don’t be shy 龴'''(ಠ|۾ಠ) ᴥ (ಠ۾|ಠ)''龴
I’m always down to chat, swap ideas and ideals, or just geek out about something cool. 
Feel free to open an issue, drop a comment, or hit me up on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/_Himokai_) or on Reddit (u/Himo-kai).
