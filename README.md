### ~ Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. <sub>***I'm***</sub> ***Himokai***<sup>*|ₑₙⱼₒᵧ ᵧₒᵤᵣ ₛₜₐᵧ|*<sup>*(⁀ᗢ⁀)*</sup></sup>
### The ***<sub>ME</sub>*** part….
+ Just a curious soul who likes coding, debating ideologies and ethics, and getting lost in Wikipedia rabbit holes. (Who wants to talk [SCP’s](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/)?)

+ I’m a fan of minimalism, space stuff, and building things that (hopefully) make life a little better.
Of course I also binge Anime, sometimes a little too much.

### How I waste my ***<sub>FREE TIME</sub>***
+ Messing around with code (I have no idea what I'm doing. Sometimes it works, if I’m lucky.)

+ Nothing. Sometimes I just do nothing, and it's cool. 

+ Anime and which ever game I'm invested in at the time. Currently that would be Dota 2 

+ Bars....
