### ~ Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. <sub>***I'm***</sub> ***Himokai*** <sup>*ᵢ  ₑₙⱼₒᵧ ᵧₒᵤᵣ ₛₜₐᵧ..*<sup>*(⁀ᗢ⁀)*</sup></sup>
### The ***<sub>ME</sub>*** part….
+ Just a curious soul who likes coding, debating ideologies and ethics, and getting lost in Wikipedia rabbit holes. (Who wants to talk [SCP’s](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/)?)

+ I’m a fan of minimalism, space stuff, and building things that (hopefully) make life a little better.
Of course I also binge Anime, sometimes a little too much.

### How I waste my ***<sub>FREE TIME</sub>***
+ Messing around with code (sometimes it works, if I’m lucky.)

+ Learning new tech (and forgetting half of it,)

+ Philosophy, astronomy, and random science facts

+ Finding simple work-arounds to weird problems

**Why?**
> *Because it's really cool.*

### Don’t be shy ***<sup>龴~</sup>****<ins>ↀ</ins>*۾ ***<sub>ᴥ</sub>*** ۾*<ins>ↀ</ins>****<sup>~龴</sup>***
I’m always down to chat, swap ideas and ideals, or just geek out about something cool.
